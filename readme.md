#### Tring to do the codewars excercises everyday => kata!

#### what is the difference between Array.push() and Array.concat()

#### on the powerset method I need to return a new object. push does not return a new object.  Array.push() returns the object pushed onto the array.  Array.concat() returns a new array with the concat'd item.
